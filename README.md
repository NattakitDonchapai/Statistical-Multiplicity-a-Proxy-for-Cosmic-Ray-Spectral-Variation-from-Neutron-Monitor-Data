# Statistical-Multiplicity-a-Proxy-for-Cosmic-Ray-Spectral-Variation-from-Neutron-Monitor-Data

The dispersion of neutrons from neutron monitors is known as statistical multiplicity.
Statistical multiplicity is used as a parameter in analyzing the spectral variation of cosmic rays. In
the experiment, data on the number of neutrons were obtained from the Princess Sirindhorn
Neutron Monitor station. The data used included neutron counts from the years 2020, 2021, and
2022. The dispersion of neutrons from neutron monitors exhibits the property of distribution, and
the value of statistical multiplicity is derived from the Poisson distribution property. The Poisson
distribution property implies that each neutron particle is independent, resulting in the variance
equaling the mean. The study found that the value of statistical multiplicity does not approximate
1.0 each day because if neutron dispersion is independent, there will be a Poisson distribution
property where the variance equals the mean. This results in the value of statistical multiplicity
being close to 1.0 because statistical multiplicity is thevariance divided by the mean. Additionally,
the data distribution is plotted using histograms, showing that the neutron data distribution every
day is normally distributed. Furthermore, statistical multiplicity is compared with the Leader
Fraction to observe trends. It was found that the statistical multiplicity value does not follow the
Leader Fraction trend, which is another parameter that accurately indicates cosmic ray spectral
changes. Therefore, the study concludes that the statistical multiplicity parameter cannot
accurately indicate cosmic ray spectral changes because neutron dispersion might not be
independent, leading to a normal distribution.
